# hello-world
Hi! I am Cameron, an MSU computer engineering student. I am interested in RF technologies and machine learning/AI. Visual object tracking is incredible to me, which is why I would like to endeavor on a project which sends video from my drone, to my PC, and then run Python AI libraries on the actively recieved footage.
